# Wide World Importers Dataset
Hello! <br>
This is an example of building an ETL pipeline in Python using the <br>
Wide World Importers Dataset which can be found here: <https://github.com/Microsoft/sql-server-samples/releases/tag/wide-world-importers-v1.0> <br>
<br>
I have created a separate SQL Server Instance to host this data <br>
however it is possible to perform something similar in a different SQL Flavor

## How to run
python main.py -> will execute the ETL. Currently, I am putting them in parquet files
